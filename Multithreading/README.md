# Serial vs Multithreading
    Both codes reads the text file "file.txt" serially. Then for serial_code it calculates the longest, 
    smallest and most common word in the file serially. The multithreaded does the same but with any 
    amount of threads specified by number_of_cores. The answer is displayed along with the time it 
    took to complete the code.
